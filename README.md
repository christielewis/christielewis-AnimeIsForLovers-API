# Anime is for Lovers - API

## Description
This application allows a user to log all of the anime they have watched and/or are currently watching. It currently allows a user to add the anime's title, a brief description, and the current season and episode that the user is on.

Often times I find myself jumping from one anime to another without finishing a season/series. Then, when I return to the show, I forget which episode I last watched.
